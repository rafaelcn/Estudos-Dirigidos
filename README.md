# Concurrency

This repository contains a number of concurrency problems and its solutions
using pthreads. The problems are organized in folders and the solutions are
written in C.

Up until now, the techniques used in the solutions range from a simple mutex to
conditionals and semaphores. Those problems are used in a discipline lectured in
Universidade de Bras√≠lia.
